hOCR-Proofreader
================

Web based JavaScript GUI library for proofreading/editing hOCR.

Features:

- Two view concept: Original layout vs. hOCR text – linked together (i.e. hovering words etc. on both sides)
- Original layout can be switched between the original image and the text rendered from hOCR at the same positions –
  really powerful to find OCR errors
- Pure JavaScript without dependencies just using current browser features
- Embeddable in other projects
